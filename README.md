This is a modpack for **Yairm's Unciv**, introducing 4 new unique civilizations with their own unique units and play styles.
## Civilizations:
### Tavaria
* The hills and highlands are the home of the hard-working, stout and bearded Tavarians; dutiful artisans and craftsmen famed for their quality and reliability with a culture known for great works of engineering.

  * Unique Unit: Great Artisan
  >The very best of the Tavarians go on to be etched in their society's histories as Great Artisans. Replacing the Great Artist, Great Artisans have more flexibility in what they are capable of, Tavaria can employ them as normal workers in the nation, founders of a Manufactory, or starters of a golden age; to which they would go on to influence their descendants of their artistry and craftsmanship.  
  
  * Unique Improvement: Grand Excavation
  >What is a Blacksmith without their metalry and resources? Grand Excavations periodically decorate the lands of Tavaria, carved deep into the ground or unto the side of hills and mountains, churning out production for the city who has suzerainty over the masterwork.

### Kharnai
* One can get desperate enough to crave the flesh of their kin, low enough to relish from such an experience; but never craven enough to be that of the Kharnai. Born in bloodshed and matured under hedonistic brutality, the Kharnai are not a people to be trifled, or even joked with; lest be stricken by them as prey.

  * Unique Unit: Savage
  >Discarding empricial equipment for pure, bloodshot brutality; the Savages of Kharnai are draped in the skins of their kill and the blood of their food. They are a rugged and dogged force, reigning supreme and an unstoppable object when attacking other units. To couple with this, their cannibalistic tendencies often refreshes and replenishes their numbers.
  
  * Unique Unit: Scourgeknight
  >Wearing the skulls and cartillage of their foes as armor respectively, the Scourgeknights are the peak in ferocity and cruelty among the Kharnai. Contrary to their name, they are not mounted on literal horses, but rather metaphorically, upon the steeds of death and war themselves. Don't let this propaganda underestimate their efficiency however, only the most disciplined of formations can bear the brunt of a Scourge horde falling down of them; and the almost-ritualistic cannibalism doesn't aid the chances of the prey either if the Scourgeknights are given respite and rest.

### Shan
* Equal parts elegant but religiously reserved; the Shanmen are a stock of people who thinks of themselves sufficely highly, with the cultural and societal backdrop to aid their claims. With a focus on traditions and philosophy, they are a thinking, proud peoples.

  * Unique Unit: Bannerlord
  >While wartime leaders are always welcome in the court of the Shan emperor, it is always wise that all things balances themselves out by having another universal facet to their being. The Bannerlord is the Shan replacement for the Great General, while exercising great capability in warfare, Bannerlords are also well-endowed in diplomacy, able to begin trade missions and beneficiary agreements with Citystates near the nation.
  
  * Unique Building: Spireshrine
  >Reaching high into the sky, as if crowning beads in a palace's crown; Spireshrines are a staple of the Shanmen and their semi-superstitious practices. Replacing the monastery, these Spireshrines do not require incenses nor wine to satiate and exemplify the faith of the people, yet offering much more cultural yield, a testament to the reserved personality of the Shan religion.
  
### Mazirya
* Not many would find the deserts to be an appealing locale for civilization, nor would many societies flourish and churn into a highly-cultured, and highly sophisticated culture; the Maziriq did and defied expectations for such standards. Crowning themselves as the golden oasis of the harsh deserts.

  * Unique Unit: Farisite
  >Bearing spears and blades tempered in the desert sun, the Farisites are a formidable force to be reckoned with when faced. Although their inferior horses limit their mobility (dulled by the aridity and dunes of their homeland); the Farisites are equipped with suffice weapon training and fill in a large number of roles in the Maziriq army. Able to fight both mounted and on foot, they combine the best of infantry warfare with cavalry shock combat.
 
  * Unique Improvement: Dryfarm
  >Owing their success to these agricultural opus; the Dryfarms are a revolutionary piece of cultivation technique, utilizing plants and crofting that expends and uses up the most few of water, while yielding the most results. While these not only produce food for a city, they also expend production value, owing to the fact that these crops are not only used as a food source, but as sources for building and textile materiel as well.
